I attend FAccT where I was part of a CRAFT panel on Community-Led Audits, and presented a study auditing Uber services with the Roma people done in collaboration with [Eticas](https://eticasfoundation.org). I also led a CRAFT session where we conduct participatory design with the FAccT community on how do we envision this community in the future. This was conduceted using [pol.is](https://pol.is/home). I enjoyed it a whole lot!
