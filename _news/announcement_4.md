I had a great time at [FAccT](https://facctconference.org) this year! I joined a CRAFT panel on community-led audits and shared a study (with [Eticas](https://eticasfoundation.org)) auditing Uberâ€™s services with the Roma community. I also co-hosted a participatory design session using [pol.is](https://pol.is/home) to explore how we imagine the future of the FAccT community together.
