It was a pleasure to speak at the [Future of Science Seminar](https://luma.com/qx2g8mee) where I led a conversation on "Navigating Risk - From Awareness to Accountability." We examined the multi-tiered harms of AI systems across individuals, communities, and society at large. A striking finding: while 80% of Americans prioritize AI safety, only 17% believe AI will positively impact the next 20 years—compared to 56% of AI experts. We explored inspiring accountability initiatives from Consumer Reports, Eticas, Radical Exchange, and DataMined, sparking important discussions on new mechanisms to hold AI companies accountable 🛡️⚖️
