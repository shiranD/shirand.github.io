It was a pleasure to speak at the [Future of Science Seminar](https://luma.com/qx2g8mee) where I led a conversation on "Navigating Risk - From Awareness to Accountability." We examined the multi-tiered harms of AI systems across individuals, communities, and society at large, as well as inspiring accountability initiatives from Consumer Reports, Eticas, Radical Exchange and DataMined, sparking important discussions on new mechanisms to hold AI companies accountable 🛡️⚖️
