I was invited to join the Advisory Council for the Massachusetts Science and Technology Policy fellowship (MASTPF). In the advisory council we will shape the long-term vision, provide strategic oversight, foster partnerships, and help launch the first cohort of MASTPF in 2026. This initiative is led by the [Scientific Citizenship Initiative](https://scientific-citizenship.org). The goal of this fellowship is to have a year long P.hD. Scientists serving directly the Massachusetts State House -- creating a bridge between science and public service 🏛️📜⚖️🎓
