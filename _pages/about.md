Welcome! I recently joined Northeastern University, where I focus on technical aspects like NLP and speech processing, as well as social-technical questions to promote Responsible AI (RAI) practices. I'm a part of the RAI team at the [Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu) (EAI). I specialize in addressing Long-Tail problems. From a technical standpoint, my work involves understanding gaps arising from low-frequency data events and devising strategies to mitigate them (the gaps, of course ;-)). On the socio-technical side, I concentrate on amplifying voices and involving stakeholders we don't hear enough from. Through this effort, I aim to contribute to the creation of more equitable and just outcomes when designing new systems.
