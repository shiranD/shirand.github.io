Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at Northeastern University, specializing in natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing, with a strong focus on promoting Responsible AI (RAI) practices at [Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu).

My research primarily revolves around understanding cultural representation within AI systems. I explore how well non-dominant cultures and values are represented, both directly by examining the outputs of these systems and indirectly by analyzing who is involved in their creation. Additionally, I am committed to enhancing inclusivity through both technical and socio-technical approaches, advocating for participatory methods in the design of AI tools.

In my role as a technical lead in the RAI consulting services at EAI, I strive to contribute to the development of AI systems that are equitable and just. Through these efforts, I aim to ensure that new technologies serve all communities fairly and responsibly.
