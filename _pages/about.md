**Hi, I'm Shiran—I research how AI systems shape our world, and how can we make them more representative.**

I'm a Research Scientist at [Northeastern University's Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu), where I specialize in NLP and speech processing with a focus on Responsible AI specifically focusing on AI auditing, and AI literacy, and participatory AI approaches. 

**What I do**

I audit AI systems to uncover what they get wrong—and who gets left out. That means examining how generative AI represents (or misrepresents) non-dominant cultures, evaluating how AI-powered search shapes access to real-world opportunities, and measuring the community impact of AI-driven services like Uber in collaboration with [Eticas](https://eticas.ai).

**How I do it**

One angle through which I make systems more grounded by investigating technical means to make them reflect broader life expereinces, and another one is through a social process, where I employ participatory design to learn what those experiences are.

I also lead the [**Tech Policy Tracker**](https://www.integrityinstitute.org/legislative-tracker), making federal and state AI policy accessible to everyday people—because these decisions affect all of us, and everyone deserves a seat at the table.

As technical lead for RAI consulting at EAI, I help companies build AI that's safe, robust, and equitable.

**The through-line:** ensuring new technologies serve all communities fairly.
