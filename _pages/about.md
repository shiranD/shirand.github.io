Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), specializing in natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing, with a strong focus on promoting Responsible AI (RAI) and AI auditing in particular at [Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu).

But, what is AI Auditing?
It's the process of examining and assessing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to ensure they are reliable, ethical, and compliant with regulations.

One form of auditing I work on revolves around understanding cultural representation within AI systems. I explore how well non-dominant cultures and values are represented, both directly by examining the outputs of these systems and indirectly by analyzing who is involved in their creation. Another form is through evalauting AI systems how well they mediate real-world opprotunities as they gradually replace traditional search engines. Additionally, beyond experts auditing, we need to look for community led auditing practices, where we as public are participating in the decision making around the design and deployment of these tools, so I gradually integrate these methods into my own research -- to promote a more democratic and active engagement.

In my role as a technical lead in the RAI consulting services at EAI, I help companies ensure their development of AI systems is safe, robust, and equitable. Through these efforts, I aim to ensure that new technologies serve all communities fairly and responsibly.
