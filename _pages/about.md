Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu), specializing in natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing, with a strong focus on promoting Responsible AI (RAI) and AI auditing and AI literacy in particular at the [Institute for Experiential AI](https://ai.northeastern.edu).

But, what is AI Auditing?
It's the process of examining and assessing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to ensure they are reliable, ethical, and compliant with regulations.

One form of auditing I work on revolves around understanding cultural representation within GenAI systems. I explore how well non-dominant cultures and values are represented. Another form is through evalauting AI systems how well they mediate real-world opprotunities as they gradually replace traditional search engines. I also have been working on auditing AI-based services such as Uber in collaboration with [Eticas](https://eticas.ai) to measure real-world impact on communities.

I have been working on AI literacy initiatives to promote civic engagement on AI decisions that are effecting all of us.

In my role as a technical lead in the RAI consulting services at EAI, I help companies ensure their development of AI systems is safe, robust, and equitable. Through these efforts, I aim to ensure that new technologies serve all communities fairly and responsibly.
